# Rate Your Dorms
Rate your forms is an online platform where students can read and write reviews of various aspects of on campus living. Currently we support reviews on dorms at 7 public universities in North Carolina and UT Austin. We plan to expand across the Eastern seabord throughout 2018 and into early 2019.

## Built With
* firebase
* JQuery

## Site Organization
This repo follows a typical site organization with all original code held within the public directory and organized into directories organized by associated school, and a seperate directory for all js functionality. Additionally, there are several html files in the public directory that correspond to unique url redirects that we use to track referalls from brand ambassadors at each school.
